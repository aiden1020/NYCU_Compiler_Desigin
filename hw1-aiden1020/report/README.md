## How much time did you spend on this project
8 hours
## Project overview

This project is implemented a flex scanner,which is used for read the input text (in this case is the programming language `p`) and break it down into a sequence of tokens.

In this project, it is required to implement the pattern matching by using regular expressions and output the defined tokens.Also, I need to handle the error input.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

I think the hardest in this project is thinking about how to fit special case for scientific notion (`0.0e1`) because `0.0` is a legal float but not for scientific notion. I spent a lot of time to think about how to fit it to the normal scientific notion regular expression. Finally, I gave up and just create a specific rule for it.

## Feedback to T.A.s

> Please help us improve our assignment, thanks.

I think the testing program is awsome. However, if there is a function to show the difference between result with sample soultion on terminal while the testing specific test case will be better.
